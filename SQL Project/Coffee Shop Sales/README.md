# Objectives
The main goal of this project is to analyze coffee shop sales data to understand business performance and customer behavior through structured data analysis. First, the project focuses on data cleaning by ensuring all dates, times, and prices are in the correct format for accurate calculation. Once the data is ready, the objective is to track key performance indicators such as total revenue, total orders, and Month-over-Month (MoM) growth to see how the business improves over time. Additionally, the project aims to identify sales patterns by looking at the busiest days of the week, the most popular store locations, and the top-selling product categories to help the shop make better business decisions.

# Recommendation
To continue the business's positive momentum, we should focus on maximizing our busiest hours by offering morning-specific promotions that highlight our most popular items like coffee and tea. Since our store in Hell's Kitchen is performing exceptionally well, we should study its operations and apply those successful methods to our other locations to help them grow. We should also look for ways to increase customer visits on weekends, perhaps through special events or family discounts, since our weekday business is currently much stronger. Finally, because our sales and order volumes are growing steadily, it is important to keep our staffing levels and inventory well-managed so we can maintain fast service as we get busier.
