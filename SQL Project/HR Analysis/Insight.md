# Objectives
The main goal of this project is to help the company understand its workers better by using SQL to turn messy data into clear answers. It aims to find out exactly how many people are leaving, which groups of employees are most likely to quit, and how happy people feel in their current jobs. By doing this, the project provides a simple guide for the HR team to fix problems, keep their best employees, and make the office a better place to work.
