# Objectives
The main goal of this project is to help the company understand its workers better by using SQL to turn messy data into clear answers. It aims to find out exactly how many people are leaving, which groups of employees are most likely to quit, and how happy people feel in their current jobs. By doing this, the project provides a simple guide for the HR team to fix problems, keep their best employees, and make the office a better place to work.
# Insight
- Active Employee Count: Tracks a total of 1,233 active employees who are currently working at the company.
- Average Age: The average age of the workforce is 37 years old, showing a mature and experienced team profile.
- Total Attrition: A total of 237 employees have left the company.
- Attrition Rate: The company has a turnover rate of 16.1%, which is a key number for HR to monitor for stability.
- Gender Trends: Among those who left, 150 were men and 87 were women, suggesting that male employees have a higher departure rate in this dataset.
- Education Background: Employees with a background in Life Sciences and Medical fields show the highest number of departures.
- High-Risk Age Group: The most frequent departures occur in the 25–34 age range, making this group the primary focus for retention efforts.
- Departmental Impact: The Sales and Research & Development departments experience more attrition compared to other areas like Human Resources.
- Satisfaction Mapping: Uses a Job Satisfaction Matrix (scaled 1 to 4) to show how happy employees are in their specific roles.
- Low Satisfaction Roles: Specific roles, such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives, show a mix of high attrition and varying satisfaction scores, identifying them as areas that may need better management or workplace changes.
# Recommendation
To improve the company's stability, we should prioritize retention programs for the 25–34 age group and employees with Life Sciences or Medical backgrounds, as these groups currently show the highest turnover rates. We need to conduct deeper exit interviews and reviews for Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives to address the low job satisfaction and high attrition found in these specific roles. Since our average employee age is 37, we have a great opportunity to create mentorship programs where our experienced staff can support and engage our younger workers. Most importantly, the leadership team must actively monitor our current 16.1% attrition rate and set a clear goal to reduce it, ensuring that our remaining 1,233 active employees are not overworked and feel valued in their roles.
