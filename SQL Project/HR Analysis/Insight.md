# Objectives
The main goal of this project is to help the company understand its workers better by using SQL to turn messy data into clear answers. It aims to find out exactly how many people are leaving, which groups of employees are most likely to quit, and how happy people feel in their current jobs. By doing this, the project provides a simple guide for the HR team to fix problems, keep their best employees, and make the office a better place to work.
# Insight
-Exact Turnover Percentage: I used SQL to calculate a precise Attrition Rate, which tells the company exactly what percentage of the workforce is leaving rather than just showing raw numbers.

-Employee Count Tracking: The project successfully tracks 1,233 active employees, allowing the company to see the actual size of the current team after departures.

-Specific Risk Groups: The data shows that certain age groups and genders have higher quit rates, helping the company see exactly where the "leaks" are in the workforce.

-Job Happiness Levels: By looking at Job Satisfaction scores (1 to 4) across different roles, I identified which specific departments are the least happy and need more attention.

-Educational Backgrounds: The analysis highlights that people with certain education fields leave more often, which might mean their studies don't match their daily tasks.
